# Advent of Code 2021

Every year I mean to do Advent of code, but by the time I remember it's the end of the year. 

This year I actually remembered :)

This is also a good time to practice scala 3 such as extensions, givens and enums.

## My personal goals
I am not trying to come up with the most optimized in speed. I am using this as a
way to practice my scala 3. Secondary goal is to think about the different components as domains.
Tertiary goal is to try to think about the functional and immutability aspects of scala. So 
many of the components i"ll be updating state by copying objects or doing recursive functions.

## Running tests:
```bash
sbt test
```
